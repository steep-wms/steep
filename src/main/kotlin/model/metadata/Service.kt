/**
 * Service metadata
 * @param id a unique service identifier
 * @param name a human-readable name
 * @param description a human-readable description
 * @param path relative path to the service executable in the service artifact
 * @param runtime the runtime to execute the service
 * @param parameters list of parameters
 * @param runtimeArgs optional list of arguments to pass to the runtime
 * @param requiredCapabilities a set of capabilities this service needs the
 * host system to have to be able to run
 * @param retries optional rules that define when and how often the execution
 * of this service should be retried in case an error has occurred. Can be
 * overridden in the workflow (see [model.workflow.ExecuteAction.retries]).
 * @param maxInactivity an optional timeout policy that defines how long the
 * execution of this service can take without producing any output (i.e.
 * without writing anything to the standard output and error streams) before it
 * is automatically aborted. Can be overridden in the workflow (see
 * [model.workflow.ExecuteAction.maxInactivity]).
 * @param maxRuntime an optional timeout policy that defines how long the
 * execution of this service can take before it is automatically aborted, even
 * if the service regularly writes to the standard output and error streams. Can
 * be overridden in the workflow (see [model.workflow.ExecuteAction.maxRuntime]).
 * @param deadline an optional timeout policy that defines how long the
 * execution of this service can take at all (including all retries and their
 * associated delays) until it is aborted. Can be overridden in the workflow
 * (see [model.workflow.ExecuteAction.deadline]).
